![Product Recommendation Model](https://github.com/Praveen76/Recommender-System-and-ConvAI-using-LLMs-on-e-commerce-Data/blob/main/Conversational%20AI.webp)

The idea of the project is to build a Hybrid Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering and Content Bases Filtering.

# Recommender System using Collaborative and Content Based Filtering:
Collaborative filtering:
-->recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.
   It assumes that users who had similar tastes in the past will continue to like similar items in the future.
Content Based Filtering:
-->Content-based filtering recommends items that are similar to those a user has already liked, based on the features or descriptions of the items.
